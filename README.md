<h3><b>Aim : Introduction to Software Engineering </b></h3>

<p>Software Engineering is an engineering approach for software development. Software engineering discusses systematic and cost-effective techniques to software development. These techniques have resulted from innovations as well as lessons learn from past mistakes. Alternatively, we can view software engineering as the engineering approach to develop software.<br>Software is : </p>

1. Instructions(computer program) that when executed provide desired function and performance.
2. Data structure that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information.
3. Documents that describe the operation and use of the program.

#### IEEE defines software engineering as :

<p>The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.</p>

#### Need Of Software Engineering : 

<p>
The need of software engineering arises because of higher rate of change in user requirements and environment on which the software is working.
</p>

<p>
<b> Large software </b> - It is easier to build a wall than to a house or building, likewise, as the size of software become large engineering has to step to give it a scientific process.
</p>

<p>
<b> Scalability </b> - If the software process was not based on scientific and engineering concepts; it would be easier to re-create new software than to scale an existing one.
</p>

<p>
<b> Cost </b> - As hardware industry has shown its skills and huge manufacturing has lower down the price of computer and electronic hardware. But the cost of software remains high if proper process is not adapted.
</p>

<p>
<b> Dynamic Nature </b> - The always growing and adapting nature of software hugely depends upon the environment in which the user works. If the nature of software is always changing, new enhancements need to be done in the existing one. This is where softwareengineering plays a good role.
</p>

<p>
<b> Quality Management </b> - Better process of software development provides better and quality software product.
</p>

#### Characterestics Of Good Software : 

<p>
A software product can be judged by what it offers and how well it can be used. This software must satisfy on the following grounds:
</p>

- Operational
- Transitional
- Maintenance

<p>
Well-engineered and crafted software is expected to have the following characteristics:
</p>

##### Operational :

<p>
This tells us how well software works in operations. It can be measured on:
</p>

- Budget Usability Efficiency
- Correctness Functionality
- Dependability Security
- Safety

##### Transitional : 

<p>
This aspect is important when the software is moved from one platform to another : 
</p>

- Portability
- Interoperability Reusability Adaptability
- Maintenance

<p>
This aspect briefs about how well software has the capabilities to maintain itself in the ever-changing environment:
</p>

- Modularity
- Maintainability
- Flexibility
- Scalability
